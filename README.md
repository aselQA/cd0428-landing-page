# Landing Page Project

```

This is the Landing Page project Udacity Frond End Web Developer Nanodegre Course. This project required me to build a multi-section landing page, with a dynamically updating navigational menu based on the amount of content that is added to the page.

The Languages used:

- Javascript
- HTML
- CSS

The Functionalities:

- Navigation is built dynamically as an unordered list;
- It should be clear which section is being viewed while scrolling through the page section;
- The link should scroll to the appropriate section when clicking an item from the navigation menu.

```
